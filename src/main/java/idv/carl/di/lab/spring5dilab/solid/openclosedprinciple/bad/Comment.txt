As apparent, this is a clear violation of the Open Closed Principle.
We need to modify the class to add support for a new functionality.
In fact, we violated the Open Closed Principle at the very first instance
we wrote the ClaimApprovalManager class. This may appear innocuous
in the current example, but consider the consequences in an enterprise application
that needs to keep pace with fast changing business demands. For each change,
you need to modify, test, and deploy the entire application. That not only makes
the application fragile and expensive to extend but also makes it prone to software bugs.
